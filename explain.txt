### Program entry

main.py read search type and search term from stdin, then call related crawl to search.

### Queue

The difference between BFS and Focused Crawl is the type of Queue. So I defined an abstract Queue class (My_Queue) with two derived class:
- My_Priority_Queue
- My_FIFO_Queue

For different crawl, just need to change the type of queue.

### Crawl

I defined a Base Crawl Class(My_Crawl) with two derived class:
- My_Focused_Crawl
- My_Bfs_Crawl

These two crawl class share the common method, the only difference is the queue's type.

### Score calculate

I use an easy way to calculate the page score:

$$ score = \frac{\# search\_terms\_count} {\sqrt {document\_length}} $$

### Related page

for each search term, related page must have at least one term.

### Crawl limit

- limit the number of links to visit in the same page: because some page like wiki could have thousands of links
- limit the number of links of same hostname
